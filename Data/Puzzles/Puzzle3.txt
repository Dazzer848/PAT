Congrats on uncovering my Litrature based riddle, I am a fan of litrature.
Some books are Intresting like George Orwell's pieces. If only i could remeber what it was called.
Its got such a dystopian feel doesnt it, relevant to today. The main character is so true today and never forget it.

Find me the book's main character.
