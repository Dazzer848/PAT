Today i went to visit the Disovery Building, wow it was so amazing. 139m on the M75 as the bird flies is something more low key.
More intresting, it looks like a prison, i wonder what secrets they are hidding.
I think the sign outside what be a great place to leave " The packadge ". They wont see it coming.
I must make sure to use .the. name at home to remeber it. Anyway the plan is moving on nicely.

Solotion name on sign * Still to find *
