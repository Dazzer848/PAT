Well done on choosing the correct career choice in life and joining the SCS

Before we continue we would just like to say you will be earning IRR 10000000 every ten years. 
This is a gracious amount and the government prides itself on taking good care of its employees and subsidiaries. 
If you are to disclose this amount you will be immediately terminated by a GBU-12 guided bomb from your truly Barrack Obama. 

Other than that we would like to state you have free will in this company and by that we are referring to the fact that you can only decide when to breathe
other than that we control every aspect of your daily life. 
Additionally we have taken ownership of all assets you once owned as a liability for any infringements on this NDA. 

We take great pride in our Health and Safety with an immaculate report that has not one incident of 
employee harassment, 
assault, 
Under paying, 
disfigurement, 
Manipulation, 
top heavy management, 
or murder 
AT ALL! You are in safe hands. 


If something is to occur, you are to
A: Not mention to anyone who, why, what or how the incident occured. 
B: The department will supply a large sum to take care of you in these trying times, ( usually between 1 and 10 IRR ) 
               
OR 

swap it out for the jovial offer of one big Mac from our local Maccers.

Our employees have rated us the best department of 2020 and this is fact. 
We encourage you to do the same or else you may not be taken care of so nicely :). 

In terms of your career security and job stability, 
we will ensure that you are always employed and ( you may not ever leave ) that you always have work to do. 
We appreciate the time and dedication that you put into your work and it will be rewarded! 
Usually with the release of one of your family members who are in the basement ( They are already there ).
Dont worry this is a completely risk free environment and mistakes are encouraged and are only a new opportunity to learn! 
Learning what it feels like to have a 50. Cal round going straight through your skull is not something most people ever learn! 
So enjoy it when you do make a mistake.

All in all this is a brief summary of all of our T’s and C’s. We can't wait for you to join our team, you have no choice.

Remember we always, Watch Predict and Protect.
